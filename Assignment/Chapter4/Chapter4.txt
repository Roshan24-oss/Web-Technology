CHAPTER 4: WEBSITE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Group A:

1 ans: Differentiate between Legibility and Readability.

Legibility refers to how easily individual characters or letters can be distinguished (e.g., font size, spacing, font style).

Readability refers to how easily a block of text can be read and understood (e.g., line length, paragraph spacing, contrast).

2 ans: The Rule of Thirds divides a page into three equal rows and three equal columns. Important elements are placed along these lines or intersections to create a balanced and visually appealing layout.

3 ans: Limiting font families:

Improves visual consistency

Enhances readability

Prevents clutter and confusion
Typically, 2–3 font families are recommended.

4 ans: Responsive Web Design is an approach where a website automatically adjusts its layout, images, and content to fit different screen sizes and devices such as mobiles, tablets, and desktops.


Group B:

5 ans: Users tend to scan web pages in an F-shaped pattern:

First, they read horizontally across the top

Then scan down the left side

Finally, read shorter horizontal sections

Influence on design:

Place important content at the top and left

Use headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs

Highlight key information early

6 ans: Colors influence user emotions and behavior:

Blue: Trust, calmness, professionalism (used in banking, corporate, and healthcare websites)

Red: Energy, urgency, excitement (used for sales, alerts, and call-to-action buttons)

Green: Nature, growth, safety (used for eco-friendly, health, and finance websites)

Choosing the right color improves user engagement and brand perception.

7 ans: The 60-30-10 Rule helps create visual harmony:

60% – Primary color (background)

30% – Secondary color (sections, headers)

10% – Accent color (buttons, highlights)



Group C:

8 ans: Importance of Image Optimization and file formats (JPEG vs PNG).

Using raw high-resolution images increases file size and slows loading time.

Image Optimization Importance:

Reduces file size

Improves page speed

Enhances user experience and SEO

File Formats:

JPEG: Best for photographs; smaller file size with slight quality loss

PNG: Best for logos and graphics; supports transparency but larger size

Solution: Compress images and use JPEG for photos and PNG only when transparency is needed.

9 ans: Critique of bright yellow background and Comic Sans for a Law Firm.

Problems:

Bright yellow: Causes eye strain and lacks professionalism

Comic Sans: Informal and playful, unsuitable for a law firm

Violates principles of color psychology and typography

Better Alternative:

Use neutral colors like navy blue, dark gray, or white

Choose professional fonts such as Times New Roman, Georgia, or Roboto
This builds trust, credibility, and seriousness.

10 ans: Missing design principle and solution using Media Queries/Fluid Grids.

Missing Principle: Responsive Web Design

Problem Explanation:
The site does not adapt to smaller screens, causing horizontal scrolling and zooming.

Solution:

Media Queries: Adjust layout and font sizes for different screen widths

Fluid Grids: Use percentage-based layouts instead of fixed widths

This ensures the website is readable and usable on all devices.
