CHAPTER 2: WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS


Group A

1 ans: A Sitemap is a visual or hierarchical representation of a website’s structure, showing all the pages and their relationships. It helps plan navigation and content organization before development begins.

2 ans: The Launch phase is when the website is made live for public access. Its purpose is to deploy the website, ensure it functions correctly on the server, and make it available to users.

3 ans : Documentation records details of the website’s design, code, features, and processes. It is important because it aids maintenance, future updates, and helps developers understand the system easily.

4 ans : Front-end and Back-end development serve different roles in web development. Front-end development focuses on the user interface and user experience, handling what users see and interact with on a website, such as buttons, menus, and forms. It typically uses technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React or Angular. In contrast, back-end development deals with the server, database, and application logic, managing what happens behind the scenes. It ensures that data is processed correctly, servers respond to requests, and features like database queries and user authentication work properly, often using technologies such as PHP, Python, Node.js, Java, and SQL. Together, front-end and back-end development create a complete, functional website.

5 ans: Planning is the most critical phase of web development because it lays the foundation for the entire project. Mistakes made during planning can lead to wasted time, increased costs, and poor results later.

Key activities during the planning phase include:

Defining the website’s purpose and goals

Identifying the target audience and user needs

Deciding the website structure (sitemap and navigation)

Selecting technologies, tools, and platforms

Estimating budget, timeline, and resources

Proper planning ensures that development proceeds smoothly and meets client expectations.


6 ans: The Maintenance phase is iterative because it involves continuous updates and improvements after the website is launched. A website needs regular attention to remain useful and relevant.

A website is never truly “finished” because:

Content needs to be updated regularly

Bugs and technical issues may appear over time

Security updates are required to prevent threats

User feedback may demand new features or improvements

Technology and design trends keep changing

Thus, maintenance is an ongoing cycle of monitoring, updating, and improving.

7 ans: Information Gathering is the first step in web development where details about the project are collected. This includes understanding client requirements, business goals, content needs, and technical constraints.

Understanding the target audience is crucial because:

It helps design user-friendly interfaces

Content can be tailored to user preferences

Navigation becomes more intuitive

The website better meets user expectations

Without knowing the audience, the website may fail to engage users effectively.



Group C 


8 ans: Skipping the Testing phase can lead to serious risks that may cost more money in the long run. Without testing, security vulnerabilities may expose customer data, leading to loss of trust and legal issues. Functional errors such as broken payment gateways or checkout failures can prevent users from completing purchases. Compatibility issues may cause the site to malfunction on different browsers or devices, driving customers away. Testing ensures a safe, reliable, and smooth user experience, which is essential for the success of an e-commerce website.


9 ans: The main problem was skipping the planning and design phases. Without a sitemap or prototype, the client could not visualize the final website, leading to misunderstandings. As a result, the developer wasted time and effort coding an unacceptable design. This should have been handled by first creating wireframes, mockups, and a sitemap, and getting client approval before coding. Proper planning and design review help avoid rework and client dissatisfaction.

10 ans: The Maintenance phase was neglected. This phase involves regularly updating content, fixing errors, improving performance, and ensuring information remains current. In a university website, maintenance includes updating exam schedules, notices, announcements, and academic calendars. Neglecting maintenance results in outdated information, causing users to lose trust and stop using the website.
